- **Correlation Matrix Notebook:** Here you can see an example of the notebook used to evaluate the correlation in a time interval, only that it can be subject to bias due to the complexity in the interactions of the system, it is more a reference measure than an accurate validation.
- **Control validation Excel:** To analyze how consistently the network responded based on different data and conditions, 30 random samples were extracted from the dataset and the percentages of cycles were iterated in the 16 possible peak combinations (0%, 100%) in each of the actuators.
The results were consistent for all 30 samples. In this file you can see a summary table with the calculations made for 10 neural networks.
