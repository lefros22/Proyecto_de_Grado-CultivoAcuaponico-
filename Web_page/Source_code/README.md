# Source code web page
Here you can see the source code of the web page, maybe I can't run the page because the folder is missing in src/bd because that's where the credentials for my personal firebase project are located, you can look for the official documentation for the firebase implementation at the node with a firebase configuration.

Documentation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?hl=es-419
